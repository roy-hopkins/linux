Description:
		(RO) The value in this attribute increments each time @inblob or

		checking generation before writing to any attribute and making
		sure the number of writes matches expectations after reading
		@outblob, or it can prevent conflicts by creating a report
		instance per requesting context.

Description:
		(WO) Attribute is visible if a TSM implementation provider
		supports the concept of attestation reports for TVMs running

		under an SVSM, like SEV-SNP. Specifying a empty or null GUID
		(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000) requests all active services
		within the SVSM be part of the attestation report. Specifying
		a non-null GUID requests an attestation report of just the
		specified service using the manifest form specified by the
		service_version attribute.
